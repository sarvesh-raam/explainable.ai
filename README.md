## 🎯 Project Overview
This research project investigates the reliability, stability, and utility of post-hoc explainability methods (**SHAP** and **LIME**) when applied to black-box machine learning models. We aim to bridge the gap between high-performance "black-box" models and the transparency required for critical decision-making in high-stakes environments.

### 🧪 Central Research Question
> *"Can post-hoc explainability methods produce faithful, stable, and useful explanations for black-box models—while maintaining high predictive performance across diverse structured datasets?"*

---

## 🔬 Research Objectives
*   **Empirical Comparison:** Evaluating the performance of Linear Models (Logistic Regression) vs. Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
*   **XAI Evaluation:** Comparing SHAP (Global & Local) vs. LIME (Local) explanations.
*   **Stability Analysis:** Measuring the robustness of explanations against data perturbations (Gaussian noise).
*   **Consistency Check:** Quantifying the agreement between different explanation methods to ensure trustworthy AI.

## 📈 Conclusion
This framework demonstrates that while advanced "black-box" models like Random Forest yield high predictive accuracy, **post-hoc explainability (SHAP & LIME)** provides the necessary transparency for high-stakes decision-making. Our **Stability Testing** confirms the robustness of these explanations, ensuring that small perturbations in data do not lead to wildly inconsistent interpretations—a critical requirement for trust in AI systems.
